# Manual build/installation

Make sure all repos are cloned on the same branch (e.g. all main or all dev branch) to ensure stardust protocol compatibility.

## Server
Run and maybe install the server from https://github.com/StardustXR/server.
Follow the README.

## Clients

After the server is running, you'll need to run some clients. Here's a demo showing some off:
